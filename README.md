# Práctica: Módulo Data Mining - SAS - Bootcamp KeepCoding - BIG DATA & MACHINE LEARNING

# Módulo Data Mining - SAS

During this practice, SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is used. SAS is one of the tools
more widespread data analysis and is capable of working large volumes of data in an agile way giving an answer
very fast. SAS has more than 200 components. During this practice **SAS / BASE, SAS / Studio, SAS / Guide and SAS / Miner** are used

Concepts covered in this practice:

- Data Cooking
   - Analysis of the objective variable: Missings, outliers, duplications, inconsistencies
   - Statistical analysis of the target variable
   - Analysis of categorical variables: Missings, outliers, elimination of variables with redundant information, generation of new characteristics of interest
   - Analysis of analytical variables: basic statistics, missings, outliers, elimination of variables, correlation study
   
- Normality analysis
- General linear model (GLM):
    - Obtaining of effects that intervene in the model (training with and without interactions in the model)
    - Error analysis
    - Model selection
    - Model test
    
- Using SAS / Miner to compare models:
     - GLM, Linear Regression, Neural Networks
  

## Statement

The objective of the practice is to tackle a realistic data mining problem following the methodology and good practices explained during the theoretical classes.

The data source collects daily updated information on fuel prices in Spain. Where it shows the gas stations and you can check the price, hours, brand and date of update of the data. The data on gas stations comes from the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda.

It will work with the official and free prices on gasoline prices of gas stations in Spain, the time collected will be a full week (from Monday to Sunday).

- **Source** (official data from the Spanish government): https://datos.gob.es/es/catalogo/e04990201-precio-de-carburantes-en-lasgasolineras-espanolas

- **Modeling:** GLM and its comparison with Regression and Neural Networks

- **Objective:** to predict the price of 95 gasoline in Spain at the provincial level, from the consumer's point of view.

- **RawData:** the dataset is located in the ** data ** folder of this repository. It is compressed in .zip format

The description of the dataset can be seen in point 1 of the document **"PracticaGasolina95_MariaAraceli_Paredes.pdf"**

## Developing

The Data Mining practice has been presented in a single document **"PracticaGasolina95_MariaAraceli_Paredes.pdf"** where the developed code has been added with explanations. This file does not only contain code, but also the steps taken and the decisions made appropriately justified.
